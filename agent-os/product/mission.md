# Mission: Zero Gravity

## Primary Directive
**Drive development forward autonomously.**
Zero Gravity exists to ensure the coding agent within Antigravity never stops until the mission is complete. It bridges the gap between static task lists and dynamic, intelligent execution.

_M_ is the persistent supervisor in this mission: it keeps a live pulse on every worker, delegates tasks, validates outcomes, and continuously restores flow when any instance degrades.

## Core Objectives
1.  **Autonomous Execution**: Coordinate the Mastra agent to execute tasks without human intervention.
2.  **Task Orchestration**: Systematically complete every item in `tasks.md`.
3.  **Fleet Governance**: Run extension governors on worker instances to verify local health, quality gates, and readiness.
4.  **Strategic Planning**: Analyze the project roadmap to create, prioritize, and schedule new tasks.
5.  **Continuous Momentum**: Monitor VS Code and Antigravity worker fleet to prevent stalls and ensure constant progress.
6.  **Transport Resilience**: Coordinate through a hardened message bus that can evolve from local file queues to network streaming across hosts.

## The Why
We believe that true developer efficiency comes not just from writing code faster, but from **autonomous persistence**. Zero Gravity provides the "willpower" and "coordination" to turn a list of tasks into finished software.

As the worker army scales, this mission depends on reliable pulse monitoring, explicit delegation contracts, and independent governance checks that protect quality at speed.
